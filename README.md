Event Planning System
=====================

Software Engineering project written for Computer Science degree

This desktop application developed for my dissertation was based on the scheduling problem, providing event scheduling functionality from a rules-based approach, which demonstrates that effective results can be achieved without the complexity of genetic algorithms. The application was implemented in Java using Swing to provide the GUI and basic persistence to store event data to a local file.

## Architecture

**Environment:** Desktop
**Back-end:** Java
**Front-end:** Java Swing (windows desktop app)
**Storage:** Local file

## Possible Improvements
- Convert front-end to Website Application
- Replace file storage with database
- Add support for cloud storage, or ability to sign-in and share/follow others.
